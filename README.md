# coinChangeCalcProject

This project was created a part of the Web102 curriculum for Creating Coding Careers. The site was created with two input buttons: one where the user enters in the sale of an item and how much money was given for said item(s).
For example: if the total of 3 items was $14.33 and the customer gave a $20 bill, the result of how much change would be given in dollars and coins.

Intially I had the amount of dollars followed by the coin change and that worked great and passed the npm test (mocha). But I added the amount of paper money as well (twenties, tens, fives) which is seen in code.

Finally the project was completed with the addition of a simple CSS file to make the page more aesthetic.
